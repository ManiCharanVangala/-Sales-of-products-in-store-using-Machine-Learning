# 🛍️ Sales of Products in Store using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze store product sales over a specific period using machine learning techniques. By leveraging both classification and regression models, we identify trends, evaluate product performance, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict and analyze sales patterns, identify top-performing products, and understand factors influencing sales.
- **Approach:** 
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature selection
  - Model building (Classification & Linear Regression)
  - Model evaluation

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - `Pandas` & `NumPy` – Data manipulation
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine Learning (classification, regression)
- **Model Types:** 
  - Linear Regression
  - Classification Models (e.g., DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, etc.)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Sales trends across time
- Product category performance
- Correlation between features and sales
- Visual insights using histograms, bar plots, heatmaps

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### ✅ Classification
Used to categorize products (e.g., high-seller, low-seller) based on features like price, promotion, category, etc.

### 📈 Regression
Applied Linear Regression to predict exact sales value based on various attributes.

---

## 📌 Results & Insights

- Identified key features influencing sales
- Built models to predict future sales
- Enabled data-driven decisions for inventory and promotions
